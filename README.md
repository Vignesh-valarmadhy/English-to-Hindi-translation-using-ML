# Neural Machine Translation (English to Hindi) with LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder

## Overview
This code demonstrates the implementation of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using deep learning techniques to translate English sentences into Hindi. The model architecture is built using Keras with LSTM layers for sequence-to-sequence translation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing to clean and format input sentences.
- Encoder-decoder architecture for machine translation.
- Sequence tokenization and padding.
- Training the NMT model with batches of data.
- Model evaluation and translation of English sentences into Hindi.

## Getting Started
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The code assumes you have a dataset containing English-Hindi sentence pairs. Ensure that the dataset is in a compatible format (CSV) and contains two columns: 'english_sentence' and 'hindi_sentence'. You can modify the dataset path accordingly.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - This code relies on several Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Ensure you have these libraries installed. You can install them using pip if necessary.

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
   ```

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The code performs data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and formatting. You can customize the preprocessing steps as needed for your dataset.

4. **Model Building:**
   - The NMT model is built using an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM layers. Model parameters such as latent dimension, batch size, and epochs can be adjusted based on your requirements.

5. **Training:**
   - The model is trained using the `model.fit_generator` function. Training data is generated in batches using a custom generator function. Training parameters can be fine-tuned for optimal performance.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - After training, the model's weights are saved for future use.
   - A decoding function is defined to make predictions on new English sentences and generate Hindi translations.
   - Sample translations are provided to demonstrate the model's performance.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the code and dataset.
2. Prepare your own dataset or replace the dataset path in the code.
3. Run the code to preprocess data, build the model, train, and evaluate it.
4. Modify model parameters and hyperparameters as needed for your specific use case.
